##Query Tuning
Both the MySQL and Postgres schemas should create and populate the tables with test data.
From there, we wrote queries for MySQL and Postgres and tuned them accordingly.
You can see the differences between the tuned and untuned queries in our observation documents.
Please contact one of us if you have any further questions.
